# Retail_Analysis
## Introduction

This project analyzes sales and customer data from a fictional retail company. The dataset consists of two main tables:

- **Sales**: contains transaction data including `Transaction ID`, `Date`, `Customer ID`, `Product Category`, `Quantity`, `Price per Unit`, and `Total Amount`.
- **Customers**: contains demographic information of customers such as `Customer ID`, `Gender`, and `Age`.

The main goal of this project is to explore sales performance by product, customer segments, and time periods. The analysis identifies top-performing products, high-value customers, and trends over time. It also provides insights into customer behavior based on gender and age groups.

To carry out this analysis, the following tools and technologies were used:

- **SQL**: for data extraction, aggregation, and manipulation.
- **Python** (pandas, SQLAlchemy): for advanced data preparation, customer segmentation, and generating datasets for visualization.
- **Power BI**: to create interactive dashboards and visualize key performance indicators (KPIs).

This project demonstrates the full workflow of a data analyst: from data extraction and cleaning, through analysis, to visualization and business insights.
